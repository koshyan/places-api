I thought I would be able to try many different things, but I ended up splurging all of it on one incredible Singapore chili crab from Awesome Always—and I have no regrets at all. The crab was incredibly fresh, with tender, succulent meat that came off the shell easily. The chili sauce was the perfect blend of sweet, savory, and spicy, with a wonderful depth of flavor that lingered on the palate.
